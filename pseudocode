NO LONGER UP TO DATE!

global variables:
conv bias
conv kernel
fc bias 
fc kernel
input (16x16)

CHANGE MODEL WEIGHTS MANUALLLY INSTEAD OF PERFORMING SHIFTS!!!!
local variables:
output spikes (24)
conv spikes (6x14x14)
input spikes (1x16x16)

input_current (16x16) (constants)
input_membrane (16x16)
conv_membrane (6x16x16 flattened) (current depend on prev layer)
fc_membrane (24) (current depend on prev layer)

simulate:
    for timestep in timesteps:
        call forward
        get 24 binary output spikes
        add to 64x24 spike array (locally define as 1 bit)
        prediction = bin with most output spikes (out of 64 timesteps)
forward:
    # integrate input current at current time step into membrane
    input_membranes += input current

    #linear activation
    for each input spike
        input spike = 1 if mem >= thresh, otherwise 0
    
    #reset membranes by subtraction
    for each input spike
        if input spike is >0
            corresponding input membrane -= thresh
        if input spike is <0
            corresponding input membrane += thresh
    
    # integrate current at current time step into membrane
    do convolution with input spikes as input, using conv bias & kernel (optimize maybe since the multiplication is 32bit * (0,1))
    conv_membrane += corresponding above result

    #linear activation
    for each conv spike
        conv spike = 1 if conv mem >= thresh, otherwise 0

    #reset membranes by subtraction
    for each conv spike
        if conv spike is >0
            corresponding conv membrane -= thresh
        if conv spike is <0
            corresponding conv membrane += thresh
    
    # integrate current at current time step into membrane
    do fc with conv spikes as input, using fc bias & kernel (optimize maybe since the multiplication is 32bit * (0,1))
    fc_membrane += corresponding above result


    #linear activation
    for each output spike
        output spike = 1 if fc mem >= thresh, otherwise 0

    #reset membranes by subtraction
    for each output spike
        if output spike is >0
            corresponding fc membrane -= thresh
        if output spike is <0
            corresponding fc membrane += thresh


    return output spikes
